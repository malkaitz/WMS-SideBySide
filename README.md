# WMTS-SideBySide
WMTS-SideBySide-Leaflet

This is an app to compare map service historic images in wmts or wms formats.
The plugin https://lab.digital-democracy.org/code/leaflet-side-by-side/ on leaflet7.7.1 is used.
The Digital Democracy plugin doesn't work in newer Leaflet versions.
The ukrainian flag was added by myself to match newer versions.
The Digital Democracy plugin donÂ´t allow place the same layer in both sides hence you can`t compare all images you have.
The code in this repo run the plugin each time a layer is selected. 
This way you can compare all images.
