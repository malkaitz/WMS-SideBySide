# WMS-SideBySide
WMS-SideBySide-Leaflet. Allow all layers each side.

This is an app to compare map service historic images in wmts or wms formats.<br>
The plugin https://lab.digital-democracy.org/code/leaflet-side-by-side/ on leaflet7.7.1 is used.<br>
The Digital Democracy plugin doesn't work in newer Leaflet versions.<br>
The Digital Democracy plugin don't allow place the same layer in both sides hence you can't compare all images you have.<br>
The code in this app allow compare all imagery loading the services each time the service imagery is changed. <br>
This way you can compare all images.<br>
