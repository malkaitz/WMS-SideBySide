# WMTS-SideBySide
WMTS-SideBySide-Leaflet

This is an app to compare map service historic images in wmts or wms formats.<br>
The plugin https://lab.digital-democracy.org/code/leaflet-side-by-side/ on leaflet7.7.1 is used.<br>
The Digital Democracy plugin doesn't work in newer Leaflet versions.<br>
The ukrainian flag was added by myself to match newer versions.<br>
The Digital Democracy plugin don't allow place the same layer in both sides hence you can't compare all images you have.<br>
The code in this repo run the plugin each time a layer is selected. <br>
This way you can compare all images.<br>
